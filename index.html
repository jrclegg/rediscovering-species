			<h3>Coelacanth</h3><p>The Coelacanth was thought to have gone extinct with the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. It was first discovered in 1938 by a trawler fisherman off the coast of South Africa. There are two species: the aforementioned West Indian Ocean Coelacanth, primarily found near the Comoros Islands near Madagascar and the Indonesian Coelacanth, first discovered by eagle eyed holidaymakers at a fish market in Sulawesi in 1997.<a href="http://www.dinofish.com/">Click to find out more</a></p><img id = "coelacanth" alt = "picture of a diver with a Coelacanth" src="https://img.fireden.net/tg/image/1496/60/1496609985232.jpg">

			<h3>Omura's Whale</h3><p>In the late 1970's, eight Balaenoptera whale specimens were caught by Japanese research whaling vessels. A futher specimen was collected in 1998 and in 2003 the whales were confirmed as a new species but it wasn't until 2014 that living specimens were confirmed to be living near Madagascar. <a href="http://www.omuraswhale.org/home#welcome">Click to find out more</a> </p><br><br><img id = "whale" src="http://cdn.grindtv.com/uploads/2015/10/omura-whale.jpg">
