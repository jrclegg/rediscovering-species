	<div>
		<strong><p class = "lazarus-summary">Lazarus species are species that either disappeared from the fossil record only to reappear later or species or populations thought to be extinct that have been subsequently rediscovered. While we can be almost 100% certain that some animals are extinct such as the Tyrannosaurus Rex, placing more recently 'extinct' animals into the extinction category can be termed as an approximation rather than absolute reality. This website exists to provide examples of lazarus species that defied their extinction status and to encourage conservationists not to write off all biodiversity listed as extinct.  </p></strong><br>

		<h2>Cuban Solenodon</h2><p>Since being discovered in 1861 only 36 examples of the Cuban Solenodon had been recorded and by 1970 it was believed to be extinct as no new specimens had been found since 1890. Three were captured in 1974 and 1975 with further surveys showing its presence at the eastern end of Cuba.</p>

				<h3>Coelacanth</h3><p>The Coelacanth was thought to have gone extinct with the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. It was first discovered in 1938 by a trawler fisherman off the coast of South Africa. There are two species: the aforementioned West Indian Ocean Coelacanth, primarily found near the Comoros Islands near Madagascar and the Indonesian Coelacanth, first discovered by eagle eyed holidaymakers at a fish market in Sulawesi in 1997.<a href="http://www.dinofish.com/">Click to find out more</a></p><img id = "coelacanth" alt = "picture of a diver with a Coelacanth" src="https://img.fireden.net/tg/image/1496/60/1496609985232.jpg">

				<h3>Omura's Whale</h3><p>In the late 1970's, eight Balaenoptera whale specimens were caught by Japanese research whaling vessels. A futher specimen was collected in 1998 and in 2003 the whales were confirmed as a new species but it wasn't until 2014 that living specimens were confirmed to be living near Madagascar. <a href="http://www.omuraswhale.org/home#welcome">Click to find out more</a> </p><br><br><img id = "whale" src="http://cdn.grindtv.com/uploads/2015/10/omura-whale.jpg">
